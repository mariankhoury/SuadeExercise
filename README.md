# SuadeExercise
This repository contains the Notebook file to run the assignment and the answers to the short questions.
Upon starting the exercise, I have realized that you are looking for an expert in Python, or for a person whose knowledge is heavily skewed towards Python than finance and I have realized I am not the person with such expertise. However, because I am the type of person that hates quitting, I could not drop the task and e-mail you that I was not able to do it. So I spent considerable amount trying to learn and apply what I have learned to come with an output close enough to what you are looking for. I was not able to run unit tests as I do not possess the knowledge to do so and I am understanding of your position to not proceed with my application. I also could not perform a uniform calculator for any data to be inserted into my code. However, I know one thing, that I am determined and a fast learner, and passionate about what I love doing, and finance and programming languages are my passion and it is something I would like to persevere to achieve either at your firm (which I would love to get the opportunity to be part of) or other firms. 

## EAD with Output.ipynb file
The EAD with Output file shows the lines of codes I have developed to obtain the Exposure at Default. This document shows step by step what I did and outputs results for each input. 

## EAD.ipynb file
The EAD file shows all the cells that I have written to find the Exposure at Default but does not include an output. 

## Data.json file
This file contains the sample data provided by the Challenge.

## Reg Questions_MK.docx
This document contains my answers to the two short essay questions as provided by the Challenge.

## Schema
The schema used is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuadeLabs/fire/master/v1-dev/derivative.json
I have matched the schema and validated the data in accordance. This is portrayed in both files EAD.ipynb and EAD with Output.ipynb
